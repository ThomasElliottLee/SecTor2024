# A simple formula for calculating probability for third-party data breach

## The Problem

Outsourcing is an important value for organizations, whether it is SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, low-code or no-code environments, the use of AI or simply consulting services. Because of the growing amount of outsourcing, the risk for a third-party data breach is a major concern. But organizations have no clue whether the frequency for a third-party data breach is 5-years or 5-thousand years.

## The Solution

The frequency for a third-party data can be calculated using *probability theory*. Calculating the frequency as a function of data breach size can allow an organization to manage third-party data breach risk in a manner that both allows more outsourcing while also ensuring that a large third-party data breach will never happen.

The following slides derive a simple formula that any organization can use: *N* x 0.06%, where *N* is the number of third-parties that could expose your data if they were to experience an internal data breach, and 0.06% is the average annual probability for a third-party to cause a third-party data breach. The formula therefore calculates the annual probability across *N*-vendors, that one of the vendors will cause a third-party data breach.

The slides include an example calculation using the formula which can serve as a guide for how to organize your vendors. The derivation, including empirical data, can be shown to regulators, board members and senior leadership to explain the basis for the calculation.
